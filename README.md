🧪 Carbon Dioxide Sensor (MG-811) Integration Guide – Enclosure Preview & Wiring
This repository provides a visual and code-based guide to integrating the MG-811 Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) Sensor into your project. You'll find design inspiration, sensor connection diagrams, and example code to get started with CO₂ monitoring using microcontrollers like the Arduino Nano or ESP32 Mini.



🔧 Features
📦 Two-part Enclosure – Separate top and bottom housing with mounting pads.

🧩 Plug-in Style Fit – Designed to allow easy placement and removal of the sensor.

🛠️ Mounting Hole Alignment – Accurate positioning for bolts and connectors.

🌬️ Dust-Free Design – Includes hollow pillars to reduce dust accumulation over time.

🔋 Battery Bay Included – Slot designed to fit a compact LiPo battery.

💻 Microcontroller Housing – Optional enclosure with slide-in cover for Arduino Nano / ESP32 Mini.



📷 What's Included
High-resolution images of the 3D enclosure design

Sensor wiring diagrams for Arduino/ESP32

Sample Arduino code to read CO₂ values

Notes on enclosure design for better airflow, dust protection, and battery/microcontroller fit

🔌 Hardware Used
